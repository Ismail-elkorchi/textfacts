B. Technical Overview

Version 17.0 of the Unicode Standard consists of:

- The core specification

- The code charts (delta and archival) for this version

- The Unicode Standard Annexes

- The Unicode Character Database (UCD)

The core specification gives the general principles,
 requirements for conformance, and guidelines for implementers. The
 code charts show representative glyphs for all the Unicode
 characters. The Unicode Standard Annexes supply detailed normative
 information about particular aspects of the standard. The Unicode
 Character Database supplies normative and informative data for
 implementers to allow them to implement the Unicode Standard.

Core Specification

The core specification for Version 17.0 is available for browsing online
 as per-chapter web pages. Because the full table of contents for the core specification is provided,
 with interactive links, no separate bookmarks page is provided for this release,
 nor are separate chapter links provided directly in this summary page
 for the Unicode Standard.
 Anchors for chapters, sections, tables, and figures in the core specification are
 shown with the convention of a "#" in the left margin of the heading or caption.
 Those anchors can be clicked on to provide custom bookmarks to any particular
 portion of the text, down to the level of subsections. Numbering of sections extends down to the subsection level, as well, to provide better referenceabiity
 of precise content.

The HTML version of the core specification is authoritative. However, for
 convenience of reference, an archival
 version of core specification is also available as
 a single pdf. (13 MB)

Code Charts

Several sets of code charts are available. They serve different
 purposes:

Chart Type

Description

Latest Code Charts

These charts are always the most current published
 code charts available, and may be updated at any time. The charts are organized by
 scripts and blocks for easy reference.
 An online index by character name
 is also provided.

Delta Code Charts

These charts show the
 new blocks and any blocks in which characters were added
 specifically for Unicode 17.0.0. The new characters and any major updates to the
 representative glyphs are visually highlighted in these charts.

Archival Code Charts

These charts contain
 the entire set of characters, names and representative glyphs at the time of publication of Unicode 17.0.0.

The delta and archival code charts are a stable part of this release of the Unicode Standard. They will never be updated.

Han Radical-Stroke Indices

There are a number of radical-stroke indices available to assist in
 the lookup of Han ideographs in the code charts.

Index Type

Description

Interactive

An interactive CJK character lookup page that supports lookup
 either by code point or by radical and stroke values.

IICore (4.1 MB)

A static radical-stroke index PDF file limited to only the
 IICore repertoire. (This RS index is seldom updated.)

Unihan Core 2020 (8.9 MB)

A static radical-stroke index PDF file limited to only the
 Unihan
 Core 2020 repertoire. (This RS index is seldom updated.)

Complete (48 MB)

A static radical-stroke index PDF file that covers the entire
 CJK ideograph repertoire for Unicode 17.0.

Complete

A static data file that corresponds to the complete radical-stroke index for Unicode 17.0.

The complete radical-stroke index is a stable part of this release of the Unicode Standard. It will never be updated.

M. Implications for Migration

There are a significant number of changes in Unicode 17.0 which may impact implementations upgrading
 to Version 17.0 from earlier versions of the standard. The most important of these are listed
 and explained here, to help focus on the issues most likely to cause unexpected trouble during upgrades.

Core Specification Changes

The navigation bar for the core specification has been improved. New content has been added for Unicode 17.0, and many other improvements have been made to the text. In particular, many tables have been updated for better display, and the representative glyphs for many more Unicode characters in examples and citations are now displayed directly in the text.

Script-related Changes

There are four new scripts encoded in Unicode 17.0. One of these scripts,
 Tai Yo, has complex layout.

General Character Property Issues

- Note the change of field labels in TangutSources.txt and NushuSources.txt.

Security and Identifier-related Issues (See UAX #31 and UTS #39.)

The Identifier_Type character property affects which characters are included in the General Security Profile for identifiers, which is a default recommendation for identifiers used in secure contexts. Depending on the Identifier_Type property value, characters are included (Identifier_Status = Allowed) or excluded (Identifier_Status = Restricted).

For Unicode 17.0, the assignments of Identifier_Type for all existing characters in recommended scripts were reviewed and updated to match the best currently available data on usage. Note changes to Identifier_Type for numerous characters, particularly those whose associated Identifier_Status changed from Allowed to Restricted. See Choosing Identifier_Type Values in UTS #39 for an associated explanation of the rationale behind these changes.

- Han Ideographs—instead of making all ideographs Recommended by default, they are now all Uncommon_Use, except for one fixed set of 19,842 Han ideographs in modern common use that are widely implemented across identifier systems. This changes the Identifier_Status of 77,838 Han characters from Allowed to Restricted

- Non ideographic characters—as result of review, the following changes occurred:

- 36 existing characters changed to Identifier_Status = Allowed as a result of Identifier_Type changes to Recommended or Inclusion.

- 1,099 characters changed to Identifier_Status = Restricted as a result of Identifier_Type changes to Obsolete, Technical or Uncommon_Use.

- Some characters changed Identifier_Type without affecting their Identifier_Status as Restricted.

- Bopomofo—the Bopomofo script is primarily limited to educational use. As a result the script has been reclassified as Limited_Use, making 74 Bopomofo characters Restricted.

- One newly-encoded character was assigned Identifier_Status = Allowed.

Segmentation (See UAX #14.)

UTC 181 approved a significant change to the linebreaking algorithm that introduces a new Line_Break character property value, Unambiguous_Hyphen. The need for this originated in changes related to handling of hyphens in Hebrew that had been approved for Unicode 16.0 (see decision 179-C25) but that proved to be problematic when being implemented in ICU. A temporary fix was made for Unicode 16.0 (see 180-C18 and section 5.6 of L2/24-162). The change for Unicode 17.0 is a more complete fix to those issues. See 181-C53 and section 6.1 of L2/24-224 for complete details.

U+034F COMBINING GRAPHEME JOINER (CGJ) is not frequently used but is essential for certain situations, including in German and in Biblical Hebrew text. Although CGJ was first added to Unicode 3.2 in 2002, it has been difficult to specify stable character properties and segmentation rules for it. An analysis of the issues has now been done. A detailed history of how the handling of this character in Unicode’s specifications has evolved over the years has been added to UAX #14. See Section 6.3 of L2/24-224 for details.

Numeric Property Issues

There is one new set of decimal digits added in Unicode 17.0, for the newly encoded Tolong Siki script. Implementations of numeric values and numeric formatting
 should take this new set into account.

CJK/Unihan Changes

- The new CJK Unified Ideographs Extension J block with 4,298 ideographs pushes the number of CJK ideographs to over 100,000.

- 18 urgently needed ideographs were added to the ends of the Extension C and D blocks.

- horizontal extension for 2,144 G-source ideographs

- horizontal extension for 306 K-source ideographs

- changes to 1,694 G-source references

- kTotalStrokes syntax change

- glyph changes for 47 G-source ideographs

- glyph changes for 384 T-source ideographs

- glyph changes for 340 J-source ideographs

- glyph changes for 1 K-source ideograph

- glyph changes for 26 V-source ideographs

See UAX
 #38, Unicode Han Database (Unihan) for further details on these changes

Standardized Variation Sequences

- A significant number of new standardized variation sequences have
 been added in Version 17.0, including 42 sequences for rotated forms
 of Egyptian hieroglyphs and 4 sequences for Sibe forms of quotation
 marks.

Changes to Code Charts

- There are a number of other Han glyph updates.

- Other glyph updates are listed explicitly in the
 delta charts index page.

- The two code charts for Egyptian hieroglyphs contain extensive functional and phonetic
 information derived from the data file Unikemet.txt, and have notable further updates for Version 17.0.

Collation-related Changes

The former documentation file, CollationTest.html, has been merged into a
 new section of UTS #10.

The DUCET ordering of Tangut components with respect to Tangut ideographs
 has been modified. See Table 16, Computing Implicit Weights, in UTS #10 for details.

Emoji Changes

For details about emoji changes, see the Unicode 17.0 emoji charts and Emoji Recently Added, v17.0.
