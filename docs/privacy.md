# Privacy Note: Fingerprints Are Not Anonymization

Document fingerprints and resemblance metrics can leak information:
- Fingerprint sets can reveal overlapping content.
- Small or unique phrases can be detectable through shingle hashes.

textfacts provides **facts-only** similarity measures. It does not claim anonymity or privacy safety.

If you need privacy-preserving workflows, you must add your own policy layer and threat model.
